Reddit- will be my main base where I post daily multiple times to multiple subreddits once I can get verified with letsverify. I see people with &quot;unverified&quot; or &quot;verified content creator&quot; next to their name. How do they get the &quot;verified content creator&quot; tag? What is that process?  X/Twitter and instagram are not really going to be worth committing a ton of time to for me Because I'm not good at using either platform, but I want to have semi curated profiles on both so I'll post weekly and pay Twitter for the blue check mark so people know I'm real.  Tiktok- I'm thinking of deleting tiktok since there's a good chance that I'll get banned before I get any traction. Clapper- I want to post here daily 45 second clean sexy clips and possibly do lives once a week and see what comes of it. Do any of yall have experience On clapper?  Snapchat- I'm thinking of getting premium so I can be setup to do 1on1 video content.  Telegram- I don't know what to do with t",

Pull audio for podcasts: Easily rip just the audio from an interview clip to repurpose for your podcast or for easier transcription.

Full transparency: This is a paid tool. I'm a solo creator, and I chose to make it a paid product to keep it completely ad-free, fast, and cover the server costs for processing the videos. I tried to price it fairly with one-time payment options so you're not stuck with another monthly subscription.

I had been using Autoshorts AI, but I couldn't find a way to make the narrator automatically match the gender of the main story character. So sometimes the story generated would have a woman, but the narrator's voice would be male, or vice versa. Any suggestions, or any ideas for a work-around? Thank you.  &#32; submitted by &#32;  /u/marquipooh   [link] &#32; [comments]",

A camera preview appears while recording, but it's only for your eyes and won't be shown in the final project. Video Editing: Edit your recordings with precision using tools like timeline scrubbing, fullscreen preview, zoom effects, video trimming, background editing, camera Zoom Effects: Zoom into important areas of your screen during recording or editing. The cursor is automatically followed in a zoom effect, but you can also target a manual selected point. Background Effects: Blur, replace, or stylize your background to match the selected aspect ratio and make zooms look seamless. You have a wide selection of images such as Landscapes, Abstract or Gradients, but you can also upload your own. Cursor Effects: Your cursor is automatically enhanced by using a modern pointer with a bigger scale and tilt so it looks like it flows around the screen, but you can also choose from a variety of pointer styles and effects to make it stand ",

    "content_text": "Hey guys, I\u2019ve been experimenting with 24/7 livestreams on YouTube and noticed something odd. I\u2019ve done 4 streams so far and they all behave the exact same way. Each time, the stream takes off at the start. My biggest one peaked at around 1k concurrent viewers, but then it just slowly bleeds down over time. Right now that same stream is sitting at only about 22 viewers, even though nothing about the content has changed. The livestream is completely shuffled so it never repeats itself, and I\u2019m running it through Upstream.so Recently, I scaled up and started running 2 livestreams at the same time, and the second one has the exact same behaviour. I even tried changing the thumbnail and title once the stream \u201cdied\u201d to see if that would bring it back, but it didn\u2019t make any difference. The other thing I can\u2019t figure out is the realtime analytics chart. The view pattern looks way too artificial, almost like some machine rhythm instead of normal traffic. Anyone here with experience in 24/7 livestreaming have some insight into this?  &#32; submitted by &#32;  /u/No_Jello_5263   [link] &#32; [comments]",

It could be anything, like &quot;There's one habit that literally changed my perspective on how to build wealth&quot; or &quot;4th habit literally changed my perspective on how to build wealth&quot;. 4) Don't kill the curiosity by answering the main question at the start, because if you did it, why should they stay till the end? 5) Build your story through answering the mini questions that you're gonna get by stepping into the viewer's shoes. You should ask yourself, &quot;What questions would I get if I were watching this video?&quot; Answer them one by one and connect them like pieces of a story that will eventually lead to the final answer, which is by the end of the video. And, you get the most possible retention this way. 6) The video editing should be visually telling or describing what you're saying in the video. I hope these tips will help you.
