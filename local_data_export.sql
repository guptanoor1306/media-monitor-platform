You should ask yourself, &quot;What questions would I get if I were watching this video?&quot; Answer them one by one and connect them like pieces of a story that will eventually lead to the final answer, which is by the end of the video.

The livestream is completely shuffled so it never repeats itself, and I’m running it through Upstream.so Recently, I scaled up and started running 2 livestreams at the same time, and the second one has the exact same behaviour. I even tried changing the thumbnail and title once the stream “died” to see if that would bring it back, but it didn’t make any difference. The other thing I can’t figure out is the realtime analytics chart. The view pattern looks way too artificial, almost like some machine rhythm instead of normal traffic. Anyone here with experience in 24/7 livestreaming have some insight into this?  &#32; submitted by &#32;  /u/No_Jello_5263   [link] &#32; [comments]','2025-08-31 15:55:14.000000',NULL,'/u/No_Jello_5263','["creator", "creator_economy", "influencer", "content_creator", "social_platforms"]',NULL,'2025-09-01 10:39:17.238070','2025-09-01 10:39:17.238071');
