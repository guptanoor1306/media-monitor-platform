## ⚠️ **VERCEL (NOT RECOMMENDED)**

**Issues with Vercel:**
- ❌ **No SQLite support** - Requires complex database migration
- ❌ **10-30 second timeouts** - AI analysis may fail
- ❌ **No background tasks** - Daily scraping won't work
- ❌ **Serverless limitations** - FastAPI not ideal for this

If you insist on Vercel:
1. Must replace SQLite with external PostgreSQL
2. Must restructure app for serverless functions  
3. Must handle timeout issues
4. Background scraping features will be lost

## 🔧 **Files Already Prepared for You:**

✅ `Procfile` - For Railway/Render deployment
✅ `requirements.txt` - Updated dependencies  
✅ `vercel.json` - Vercel config (if needed)
✅ Database config updated for cloud deployment

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDATION:**

**Start with Railway** - It's designed for apps like yours:
1. **5-minute setup** 
2. **Everything works** (AI, scraping, database)
3. **Professional hosting** at $5/month
4. **Scales automatically**

**Try Render first** if you want to test for free, then upgrade to Railway for production.

**Avoid Vercel** for this type of application - it's meant for frontend apps and simple APIs.
